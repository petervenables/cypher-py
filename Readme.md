# cypher-py

Cypher-py is a project I started to work through development of some cypher 
  methods that my daughter and I worked on together while she was watching
  Gravity Falls. It was a great opportunity to work through algorithms with
  her and I have subsequently returned to the code to re-implement and 
  extend this work. I'm aware there are other (and better) Python cypher 
  implementations (see James Lyons: https://github.com/jameslyons/pycipher)
  but this is my project for my benefit. 

## Getting Started

At present this module exists as a library for encoding and decoding according
  to the implemented cyphers. Include and employ. 

### Prerequisites

This is implemented with Python 3 and has not been tested with earlier 
  versions.

## Acknowledgements 

As mentioned above, I have seen the project work of James Lyons 
  https://github.com/jameslyons/pycipher but in the spirit of learning, I am 
  not refering to it during development.
